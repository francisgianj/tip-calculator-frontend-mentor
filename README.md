## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Superset of CSS


### What I learned
 
When I started to create this project, there weren't a lot of expectations that I had for myself. I'm not a visual person, I think logic is best suited for me. That's why I think front-end development is not my thing. While creating this project, I was studying and watching lectures about HTML and CSS. These resources gave me the knowledge to pursue finishing this project within two weeks. And within that two weeks, there's a lot of frustration and procrastination because of a certain problem, Most specifically with overflowing of elements. Besides all of that, I learn how to use some of the complex CSS properties like flex and grid, and it's my first time using media queries too for responsive design. I also learned how to use the rem length unit and how rem differs from px. This is just two weeks of coding with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I have so much to learn in the future and I'm looking forward to it.

Also, I jumped out learning SCSS because it saves me time from writing repetitive codes. And it's more organized that's why I got less confuse with my codes.

### Continued development
After finishing this project, I still have many things to understand. But, I'd like to learn a JavaScript framework like React next and deeply understand complex CSS properties like grid and flex.

### Useful resources

- [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380xvFSUmToMMzERZ3qB5Ueu) - This lecture helped me understand web programming better.

- [The coder coder's How to Make a Landing Page](https://youtu.be/aoQ6S1a32j8) - This video introduced me to Frontend Mentor and inspired me to do a project and to sharpen my skills.
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide to Flexbox (it also serves as your cheatsheet to flexbox) helped me to understand how flexbox's works.

## Acknowledgments
I want to thank my friends who are giving me words of affirmation while building and showing this project to them. To YouTubers who are creating videos, lectures, and tips and tricks contents about programming, if it wasn't for you guys programming would be hard and boring to learn. This is my first Frontend Mentor project and I'd like to do more.
